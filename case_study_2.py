# ## Case Study 2 

# %% [markdown]
# There is 1 dataset(csv) with 3 years worth of customer orders. There are 4 columns in the csv dataset:
# index, CUSTOMER_EMAIL(unique identifier as hash), Net_Revenue, and Year.
# 
# For each year we need the following information:
# - Total revenue for the current year
# - New Customer Revenue e.g. new customers not present in previous year only
# - Existing Customer Growth. To calculate this, use the Revenue of existing customers for current
# year â€“(minus) Revenue of existing customers from the previous year
# - Revenue lost from attrition
# - Existing Customer Revenue Current Year
# - Existing Customer Revenue Prior Year
# - Total Customers Current Year
# - Total Customers Previous Year
# - New Customers
# - Lost Customers
# 
# Additionally, generate a few unique plots highlighting some information from the dataset. Are there any
# interesting observations?
